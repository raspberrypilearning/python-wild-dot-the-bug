<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Can Dot see?</h2>

Let’s give Dot the Bug two cartoon eyes!

You can use `fill('white')` to change the colour, and `circle(x, y, size)` to draw each one.

Remember: the eyes are just smaller circles. You can place them anywhere on Dot’s body.

Try changing the position or size to make Dot look sleepy, surprised, or silly!

### Tip

Try moving the eyes closer together or further apart.  
You can even make one eye bigger than the other!  
Change the numbers to create your own unique look.

### Debugging

If the eyes don’t appear:<br />
- Make sure `fill('white')` comes **before** the eye circles<br />
- Check that each `circle()` has 3 numbers: x, y, and size<br />
- Try zooming out if you made the eyes too big!
