<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Apostrophes in action</h2>

Apostrophes can be useful in writing.

To include an apostrophe in a string, you can surround the sentence with **double quotes** `"` instead of single quotes `'`.

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 4
line_highlights: 4
---
print("One kid's sandwich had already disappeared.")
--- /code ---
</div>

<div class="c-project-output">
One kid's sandwich had already disappeared.
</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip

Use **double quotes** around a sentence if it includes an apostrophe.<br />
For example:<br />
- "That's mine!"<br />
- "Jess's sandwich was gone."

</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--debug">

### Debugging

If you get an error, check that:<br />
- You used double quotes around the whole string<br />
- You didnâ€™t accidentally end the sentence too early with an apostrophe

</div>
