# Mentor Notes: Dot the Bug

## Project Overview

In this beginner project from the **Python Wild** series, learners use the p5 Python library to draw and decorate a cartoon bug made of shapes. Each step builds on the last, and the final stage encourages personalisation and creativity.

---

## What Learners Will Practise

- Drawing with `circle()`, `line()`, `triangle()`, `arc()`
- Using colour and shape layering
- Exploring coordinates and positioning
- Customising visual output with confidence
- Using `radians()` for arcs

---

## Teaching Tips

- Start with simple changes to build confidence (e.g. colour, size)
- Reinforce how the order of code affects what appears on top
- Let learners take their time to decorate and experiment
- Use printouts or screenshots to share their critter creations

---

## Extension Ideas

- Add animation (Dot wiggles, walks, or blinks)
- Add interactivity (Dot reacts to key or mouse)
- Create a scene with multiple insects and a background
